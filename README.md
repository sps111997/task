This repository consists of two applications: the **Frontend** application (React-based) and the **Backend** application (Node.js + Express-based).

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **MUI** (Material UI): For UI components and design elements.

#### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side code.
- **Express**: Framework for building the backend RESTful API.

```bash
npm run start
